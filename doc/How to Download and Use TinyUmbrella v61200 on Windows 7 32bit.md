1. Download TinyUmbrella v6.12.00 (32-bit) from [FileHorse](https://www.filehorse.com/download-tinyumbrella-32/), which is a trusted source for software downloads[^1^]. The file size is about 36 MB and it is a freeware program.
2. Install TinyUmbrella on your Windows 7 PC by running the setup file and following the instructions. You may need to have Java Runtime Environment installed on your PC for TinyUmbrella to work properly.
3. Connect your iOS device to your PC via USB cable and launch TinyUmbrella. The program will automatically detect your device and display its information, such as serial number, model, firmware version, etc.
4. Click on the "Save SHSH" button to backup your SHSH blobs to your PC and to Cydia servers. This will ensure that you can restore or downgrade your firmware in the future, even if Apple stops signing it.
5. If you want to restore or downgrade your firmware, you can use TinyUmbrella's "TSS Server" feature, which will trick iTunes into using the SHSH blobs stored on Cydia servers or on your PC. To do this, you need to download the firmware file that you want to restore or downgrade to from [TinyUmbrella's website](https://tinyumbrella.en.lo4d.com/windows) [^2^] or other sources.
6. Put your iOS device into recovery mode by holding down the power and home buttons until you see the iTunes logo on the screen.
7. Open iTunes and click on the "Restore" button while holding down the "Shift" key on your keyboard. This will allow you to browse for the firmware file that you downloaded earlier.
8. Select the firmware file and click "Open". iTunes will then start restoring or downgrading your device using the SHSH blobs provided by TinyUmbrella's TSS Server.
9. Wait for the process to finish and enjoy your restored or downgraded iOS device.

TinyUmbrella is a powerful and useful tool for iOS users who want to have more control over their firmware versions. It can help you save your SHSH blobs, restore or downgrade your firmware, and even fix some common errors that may occur during jailbreaking or updating. However, it is not a tool for beginners and it requires some technical knowledge and caution. Make sure you backup your data before using TinyUmbrella and follow the instructions carefully.
