## NFT Collections

You can define different rarity levels for your objects and assign them different materials, colors, textures and attributes. You can also control the randomness and variation of your collections with various parameters. NFT Collections can generate a JSON file with all the metadata of your collection, such as name, description, rarity and traits. You can also export your collection as a single OBJ file or as separate OBJ files for each object.
 
With NFT Collections, you can unleash your creativity and create unique and diverse collections of 3D objects. You can use any kind of object in your collection, such as characters, animals, plants, vehicles, buildings, abstract shapes and more. You can also mix and match different objects to create interesting combinations and variations. For example, you can create a collection of robots with different heads, bodies, arms and legs. Or you can create a collection of flowers with different petals, stems and leaves. The possibilities are endless!
